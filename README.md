Hello everyone
this basic django project was made by a Urology resident and django beginner ,
It contains authentication accounts app for registering,sign in,
It also contains patients app for adding,viewing,editing pts data ,these features are limited for users, Only HomePage with small amount of data is viewable by publics non users
that is meant as an overview for revealing small amount of data of pt adding at a specific time (eg today) without revealing sensetive data (eg. Name of patients),

Project is regularly being updated for improvements,
Your suggestions are much appreciated,
